What is APICheck?
------------------

.. _apicheck_structure:

``APICheck`` is a **toolset** that can help you interact with REST APIs. This means the project is a collection of tools.

Why another REST APIs tool?
---------------------------

``APICheck`` aims to be a universal toolset for REST APIs, allowing you to mix and match its own commands, and even integrate with third party tools. This way we hope that it will be useful to a wide spectrum of users that need to deal with REST APIs.

Having in mind the tasks our target users have to complete, we classified them into three distinct categories:

- :doc:`Security Engineers / Penetration Testers </uses_cases/pentesters>`
- :doc:`Developers </uses_cases/developers>`
- :doc:`System Administrators </uses_cases/sysadmins>`

The ``APICheck`` toolset is useful for the above three user profiles.

What exactly is the toolset made from?
--------------------------------------

``APICheck`` components are divided in two types:

- Commands: are small utilities.
- Tools: do more complex actions.

.. note::

    You can check the complete information about :samp:`commands` and :samp:`tools` into :ref:`Core Concepts Page for more information <apicheck_structure>`
