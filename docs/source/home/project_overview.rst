Why another REST APIs tool?
---------------------------

``APICheck`` aims to be a universal toolset for REST APIs, allowing you to mix and match the commands it provides, while at the same time allowing interoperability with third party tools. This way we hope that it will be useful to a wide spectrum of users that need to deal with REST APIs.

We have classified our target users according to the kind of tasks they may be facing:

- :doc:`Security Engineers / Penetration Testers </uses_cases/pentesters>`
- :doc:`Developers </uses_cases/developers>`
- :doc:`System Administrators </uses_cases/sysadmins>`

The ``APICheck`` toolset is useful for the above three user profiles.

What exactly is the toolset made from?
--------------------------------------

``APICheck`` is comprised of two types of components:

Commands
    are small utilities.
Tools
    do more complex actions.

.. note::

    You can check the complete information about :samp:`commands` and :samp:`tools` into :ref:`Core Concepts Page for more information <apicheck_structure>`
