``API-Check`` aims to be, not only a generic toolset for REST APIs, it aims to be the tool that allow integrate with other tools.

The idea of ``API-Check`` is to be useful for everybody that need to use REST APIs. Depending of the thinks you need to do we classified the user focused profiles in three groups:

- :doc:`Security Engineers / Pentesters </uses_cases/pentesters>`
- :doc:`Developers </uses_cases/developers>`
- :doc:`System Admins </uses_cases/sysadmins>`

The ``API-Check`` toolset are useful for these three profiles of users.
