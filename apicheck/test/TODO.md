OpenAPI Data Generator
======================

[ ] Include dataclass hierarchy for OpenAPI Types
[ ] Link these dataclasses into Response dataclass
[ ] For each OpenAPI type dataclass, build a data generator with 3 working modes: regular data, random data (for fuzzing), from wordlist (for attacks)
[ ] Build a rules file for which you can define the data generator for each end-point and parameter.
